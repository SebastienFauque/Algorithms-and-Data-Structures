For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next 
multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 
rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous 
multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 
rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their
 rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate 
 helper "def round10(num):" and call it 3 times. Write the 
 helper entirely below and at the same indent level as 
 round_sum().


round_sum(16, 17, 18) â†’ 60
round_sum(12, 13, 14) â†’ 30
round_sum(6, 4, 4) â†’ 10
